## ðŸ“Œ What is CSS ?
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and design of web content written in HTML. It allows web developers to apply styles, such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, to HTML elements. CSS helps in separating the structure and content of a web page (handled by HTML) from its visual presentation. By defining rules and styles for elements, CSS enables the creation of visually appealing and consistent web pages across various devices and screen sizes.
