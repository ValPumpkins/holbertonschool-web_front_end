## 📌 What is HTML ?
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**

HTML is the fundamental language used for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of markup elements or tags. These tags are used to define various page elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML forms the backbone of a web page, organizing and displaying text, images, and other media in a way that is readable and interactive by web browsers.
